# O'Reilly School of Technology

I completed these projects as part of the requirements for the now defunct O'Reily School of Technology (http://www.oreillyschool.com/). They provided an introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ajax. I've focused a majority of my programming work on Python, but I have a solid understanding of the basics of these languages (plus PHP) thanks to the School of Technology.

**Demonstrates use of the following:**
* Esri JavaScript API
* Modernizr and Local Storage
* JSON and serializing objects
* BootStrap CSS
* Sample portfolio/resume site
* Sample interactive website
* Sample to-do list application with mapping

**Usage:**

    Can be seen in any web browser. The Ajax project requires a web server to be displayed correctly. 
    IIS is what I used to do this.
    
**Purpose:**

    Demonstrates understanding of introductory HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ajax concepts.
